# ios_clone

Hi there!

The objective of creating this Iphone clone is to showcase the skills I have learnt while attending Nology's software engineering program. 


For this particular project, I have decided to use the BEM notation to structure my properties. BEM stands for 'Block__Element--Modifier'. Using BEM is an efficient way to change and edit CSS properties at a large scale.


I have also included the use of external pre-set SCSS variables which contain properties. Using external SCSS files for preset variables is a great tool to use for larger, complex projects as it makes CSS more modular and easier to read. These external properties are located within a seperate directory (scss-docs) and will be imported with the '@import' command.
